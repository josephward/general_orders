# General Orders
A game based on the journey of you as a soldier through the military of a fictional country. You will climb the ranks of the Army officer corps, and learn tenants of leadership through various command posting.
## Next Steps (Road to Version 1.0)
## Version Format
Versions will follow the following format: release number.feature number.bugfix number (ex. 1.3.20). Release number refers to the number of full releases that the game has had. The feature number is the number of features that have been created between releases. This can also refer to the number of major changes to the code, such as an addition of a backend class or a new set of graphics. Finally, the bugfix number is the number of major bugfix 'sessions' that have be released. Because bugfixes will not really happen until after a major release this number may rarely be incremented.
