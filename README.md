# General Orders
A game based on the journey of you as a soldier through the military of a fictional country. You will climb the ranks of the Army officer corps, and learn tenants of leadership through various command posting.
## Note on File Structure
As a note for mostly myself, here is the current file structure setup for this project. This section should be updated every time a new directory is added or the file structure philosphy changes.
### lib
This directory holds the files for other librarys that we will import. This will probably hold libraries for any GUI software we will be using.
### src
This directory holds the source files for the project. This will likely be the bulk of the files.
### tests
This one is obvious, this directory holds the code the compiles tests for the codebase.
## Next Steps (Road to Version 1.0)
## Version Format
Versions will follow the following format: release number.feature number.bugfix number (ex. 1.3.20). Release number refers to the number of full releases that the game has had. The feature number is the number of features that have been created between releases. This can also refer to the number of major changes to the code, such as an addition of a backend class or a new set of graphics. Finally, the bugfix number is the number of major bugfix 'sessions' that have be released. Because bugfixes will not really happen until after a major release this number may rarely be incremented.
## Installation
This project utilizes CMake in order to install. Further instructions will be placed here as they become useful.
